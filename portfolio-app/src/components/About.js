        Hi! I'm Annika. I work as a frontend developer in Mosj√∏en, Norway. I
        love combining code with good UX/UI and great design.

        <p>
          My interest in coding started back in 2010 creating blog themes with
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but it wasn't until 2019 I decided to turn
          my hobby into a career. In March 2020 I started studying Frontend
          Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, and I
          could not be happier. <br /> <br />
          Today I have the priviledge of working as a Frontend Developer in a
          startup company, being there every step of the way building our own
          products and helping various clients build their digital brand and
          identity. Here you can check out some of the websites I've created.
